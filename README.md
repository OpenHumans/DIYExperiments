# DIY Experiments: Prototyping

**Why join now?** We have support this summer for data analysis & visualization for people that do prototyping -- join ASAP!

We'd love to have you join us! üòç To join, you can...

(1) [Use our Slackin bot to make an account](http://slackin.openhumans.org/), then (2) join the [#diy-experiments channel in Open Humans Slack](http://slackin.openhumans.org/) to chat.

(3) [Add your experiment to this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raLOqcEdJ73guiBmprv6qOXdH7sQI8m6lY7E6BX3BiY/edit#) and you'll be upgraded to the core collaborating team. üòâ

## N-of-1 self-experiment with personal data.

Do you have a question about yourself? Set it up in an A/B format, and collect data to answer your question.

Example:
* Question: "Does alcohol impair my sleep?"
* Test: Alternating weeks -- zero alcohol vs. a beer every evening.
* Collect data: Sleep tracker + morning sleep satisfaction survey

## Real examples so far...

* Does listening to music affect my mood?
* Does skipping breakfast affect my tremor?
* Does intermittent fasting help with my caloric goals?

We aim to ask questions and observe a change in data we're measuring. (Or no change!) We can use data sources already supported by Open Humans, but don't feel limited to it.

## Learn more about our goal.

The goal is scale-up: we want to see community-led research. But research starts with you -- answering your own question is exciting! We think that's the natural starting point for growth. A [1-pager here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onavSwWbV3y0pMvT_VXApx-vmyDpxWryNKNBaGZ_2Rs/edit) describes this idea in more detail.

We hope this prototyping will result in...
* Improved data imports in Open Humans
* A set of open source data analysis notebooks that can be re-used in [Open Humans](https://exploratory.openhumans.org/)
* Most importantly, a _much_ better idea of how to design a self-experimentation site/ecosystem
