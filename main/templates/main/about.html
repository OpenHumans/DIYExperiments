        <p>
            Data files created by the app are stored in your Open Humans

            activity page</a>.

        <h2>Code &amp; deployment</h2>
        <p>
          This project website is an
          <a href="https://github.com/OpenHumans/DIYExperiments">open source Django app</a>,
          and is deployed using
          <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. It uses our
          <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/oauth2-features/">standard APIs</a>
          to interact with the main platform. That means you could build something
          like it! We love to support projects created by others â€“ please chat with
          us in our <a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org">community slack</a>.
